## 🧠 Overview

**Scrivener** is a Windows desktop application built to support writing projects that require planning, structure, and iterative development. Instead of working in a single linear document, users can divide content into sections and manage them within a unified project workspace.

The software is commonly used for novels, screenplays, academic work, and technical documentation. Its design encourages organization and experimentation, allowing writers to develop ideas while keeping full control over project structure.
